You created a branch

*Creating a branch allows you to edit your project without changing the main branch. Now that you have a branch, itâ€™s time to create a file and make your first commit!

*What is a commit?: A commit is a set of changes to the files and folders in your project. A commit exists in a branch.

-The following steps will guide you through the process of committing a change on GitHub. Committing a change requires first adding a new file to your new branch.

1-On the Code tab, make sure you're on your new branch my-first-branch.
2-Select the Add file drop-down and click Create new file.
3-create new file option
4-In the Name your file... field, enter PROFILE.md.
5-In the Edit new file area, copy the following content to your file:

6-For commits, you can enter a short commit message that describes what changes you made. This message helps others know what's included in your commit. GitHub offers a simple default message, but let's change it slightly for practice. First, enter Add PROFILE.md in the first text-entry field below Commit new file. Then, if you want to confirm what your screen should look like, expand the dropdown below.

In this lesson, we'll ignore the other fields and click Commit new file.

Note: Like before, you can wait about 20 seconds, then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from) and GitHub Actions will automatically close this step and open the next one.
