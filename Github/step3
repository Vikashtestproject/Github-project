Nice work making that commit sparkles

Now that you’ve created a commit, it’s time to share your proposed change through a pull request!

*What is a pull request?: Collaboration happens on a pull request. The pull request shows the changes in your branch to other people. This pull request is going to keep the changes you just made on your branch and propose applying them to the main branch.

-keyboard Activity: Create a pull request
You may have noticed after your commit that a message displayed indicating your recent push to your branch and providing a button that says Compare & pull request.

If you want, feel free to click Compare & pull request, and then skip to step 6 below. If you don't click the button, the instructions below walk you through manually setting up the pull request.

1-Click on the Pull requests tab in your repository.
2-Click New pull request.
*In the base: dropdown, make sure main is selected.
3-Select the compare: dropdown, and click my-first-branch.
4-Click Create pull request.
5-Enter a title for your pull request: Add my first file.
-The next field helps you provide a description of the changes you made. Feel free to add a description of what you’ve accomplished so far. As a reminder, you have: created a branch, created a file and made a commit!

Note: Like before, you can wait about 20 seconds, then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from) and GitHub Actions will automatically close this step and open the next one. As a perk, you may see evidence of GitHub Actions running on the tab with the pull request opened! The image below shows a line you might see on your pull request after the Action finishes running.
